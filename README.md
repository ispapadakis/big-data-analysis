Examples of Data Analysis Using Big-Data Methods

---

## Example I: [Analysis of Financial Option Data using a Jupyter Notebook](Call_Put_Options.ipynb)

Contains:

- Ways to quickly retrieve financial data from free-access sources

- Pandas code that can be applied to much bigger datasets as well

- Efficient merging of Pandas data frames

- Concise (Pythonic) ways to create new variables

- Hassle-free plotting and data presentation using (mostly) default Pandas commands and settings


## Example II: Credit Risk Data Analysis

- Part A / [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/yanpapadakis/credit-default-risk-data-eda)

- Part B / [Probability of Default Model](https://www.kaggle.com/yanpapadakis/credit-risk-model-v1)

Contains:

- Systematic way to do Exploratory Data Analysis

  - Missingness Correlation Matrix
  - Graphical One-Way Effect Analysis using Single Variable Decision Trees
